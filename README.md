# smartphone-data-analysis-web-scraping
End-to-end smartphone data analysis using Selenium for web scraping, multi-round data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis to understand smartphone pricing and features.


This project focuses on building an end-to-end data analysis pipeline using real-world data.
The dataset was collected through web scraping, cleaned in multiple stages, and analyzed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand smartphone pricing and features.

Instead of using a ready-made dataset, the complete process starts from HTML extraction and ends with data insights, which makes this project closer to real industry workflows.
